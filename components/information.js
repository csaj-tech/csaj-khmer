            The Cambodian Studentsâ€™ Association of Japan (CSAJ) is an
            association composed entirely of Cambodians pursuing academia in
            Japan. As we are a nonprofit organization, we require sponsorships
            and donations to operate our programs and execute our activities and
            welcome any form of monetary support. Your patronage will enable us
            to perform our roles diligently and maintain good communication with
            Cambodian students and foreign correspondents in order to
            successfully carry out our missions. Your invaluable help will allow
            CSAJ to provide comfort and shelter to Cambodian students in Japan
            as well as to strengthen the relationship between Cambodian and
            Japanese and other foreign communities, providing solidarity to
            Cambodian students and people of the next generation.
