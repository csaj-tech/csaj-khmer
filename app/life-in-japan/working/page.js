                  It is recommended that you apply for a work permit at the

                  for the work permit to be issued. Once your work permit is
                  approved, the immigration officer will put a sticker on your
                  passport and stamp the bottom space on the back of your
                  residence card with the work permit stamp. Please be aware
                  that your work permit will become invalid once you leave your
                  school, since you will no longer be doing activities related
                  to being a student. Additionally, in order to have this work

                  When it comes to working in Japan, the most important thing to
                  keep in mind is recruitment. Job hunting should start as soon
                  as recruitments are available. After all, the early bird
                  catches the worm and Japanese students are earlyâ€¦ in fact,
                  Japanese students start job hunting so early it is the norm to
                  secure a posting one year before graduation, not after
                  graduating. That is to say, if you are doing your bachelor's
                  degree then you should start your job hunting at the end of
                  your third year. If you are in your master's, begin looking
                  for a job posting at the end of your first year. So keep an
                  eye out for recruitments and apply as soon as you can! But
                  where can you seek out recruitments? Well, here are some

                  in Japan, itâ€™s good to take Japanese language courses
                  concurrent with your major! Better yet, learn (a bit of)
                  Japanese before you move here. It's always helpful to know the
                  language considering the fact that Japanese society as a whole
                  is not very English-friendly. But donâ€™t be discouraged, there
                  are English-speaking companies out there! Big tech companies,
                  international firms, and some startup businesses use English
                  as their primary mode of communication. However, youâ€™ll need
                  to actively look for information yourself as itâ€™s not possible
                  to apply to those companies through recruitments.

                  Graduates who are entering the workforce must remember to
                  apply for a work permit or employment visa as the residence
                  card with â€˜Studentâ€™ status becomes ineffective immediately
                  after graduation. Japan has a lot of different types of work
                  and long-term visas to apply for based on the employment and
                  reason for living in Japan. The type of work visa you need
                  depends on the type of job that you have. While requirements
                  may vary from visa to visa, some general requirements when
                  applying for a work permit in Japan are:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc text-left md:text-justify text-gray-700">

                  The Certificate of Eligibility is an essential document when
                  applying for any Japanese visa. This certificate is issued by
                  the Immigration Services Agency of Japan. You can submit this
                  form either in person or you can mail it. To obtain this
                  certificate, there are some documents you must submit:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc text-left md:text-justify text-gray-700">

                  <li>filled out and stamped the return envelope.</li>

                  Again, depending on your employment, there are additional
                  requirements to fulfill. For example, those applying for a
                  researcher visa need to provide the following:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc text-left md:text-justify text-gray-700">

                  <li>
