                                    Speaking of Japanese food, we all might have come across a few such as sushi, ramen, mochi, etc.
                                    However, a typical japanese meal usually consists of rice, miso soup (fermented soy-bean paste soup) and protein like fish, making it a well-balanced meal.
                                    Maintaining a healthy diet is crucial when studying abroad as it provides you necessary nutrients and energy to stay focused and perform well academically.

                                    Selecting the right program is a crucial first step on your journey.Depending on your major, there are various programs such as MEXT scholarships, JASSO program, and others, where most of the opportunities can be found on the Embassy of Japan in Cambodia homepage.
                                    Intensive research and gathering information from different sources such as the internet, family, friends, teachers and acquaintances, can also be beneficial.
                                    Once you have selected the appropriate program, the application process is the next step.
                                    To ensure a successful application, it is crucial to plan ahead, carefully review all requirements, and be mindful of deadlines.

                                    Regardless of your program, in order to be able to communicate effectively and navigate around, language acts as a bridge.
                                    While many Japanese study the English language in school, the majority of the population still do not speak English.
                                    Picking up a new language might sound scary, but it might be the most exciting part about studying abroad. Learning Japanese will not only benefit you academically and in everyday life, but it will also give you a chance to deepen your understanding about the culture itself, as well as feeling more connected to the country.
                                    You can start from studying Hiragana, Katakana and some often used Kanjis to familiarize yourself with the language before coming here.

                                    It is never too early to start preparing for the paperwork ahead of time to avoid procrastination and missing deadlines.
                                    Some important documents might include passport, birth certificate, school diploma and transcripts (translated in English), in order to apply for Student Visa and Certificate of Eligibility.
                                    Booking flight tickets early might be also a good idea too during this process to get the best price.

                                    I think most students might be wondering how much it costs to fund your studies in Japan and how much money you should prepare.
                                    While there is no real answer to this, the tuition might vary from schools and majors, but you can estimate the amount by using <a class="underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline" href="https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/planning/academic-fees/">this</a> as a reference.

                                    it is better to make a financial plan and secure some money enough to make sure that you can live comfortably and afford basic necessities when you first arrive in Japan.

                                    Life here starts a bit later than in Cambodia meaning that a typical school day starts around 9am lasting until 4pm with about an hour lunch break in between.
                                    Outside of classes, many students in Japan are also involved in extracurricular activities which we called “部活Bukatsu” ranging from sports, arts to research and volunteering.
                                    This can also act as a platform for students to make new friends and build connections balancing study and social life.

                                    There will be times when you feel homesick, burnout, and moments when you feel like giving up, however, these struggling times are when you grow the most.
                                    Therefore, having an emotional support system is essential to keep your mental health in check.
                                    This kind of support can come from your family, friends, mentors, advisors or counselors, and last but not least, from the Cambodian Students’ Association in Japan.
                                    Hopefully, by communicating your struggles and concerns, it can help you cope with those , or at least having an outlet where you can express yourself and feel heard.
